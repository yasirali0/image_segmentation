## Image Segmentation Using U-Net Model

- Understand the Segmentation Dataset and write a custom dataset class for the image-mask dataset.

- Apply segmentation augmentation to augment images as well as their masks. For image-mask augmentation, `albumentation` library is used.

- Plot the image-mask pair.

- Load a pre-trained state-of-the-art CNN model for the segmentation problem i.e., U-Net using the `segmentation_models_pytorch` library.

- Create a train and evaluator function which will be helpful to write a training loop.
